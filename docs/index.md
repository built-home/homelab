# Built@Home

An opensource and collaborative approach to building homelab's. The idea is to acknowledge that we can expose homelab implementation while increasing security and monitoring. The intention is to learn and cover more ground by working together.

> Nothing is done in a vacuum, we must all stand on our forefathers to better ourselves and the world around us
